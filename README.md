This repository showcases the projects I had the most fun with and put the most effort into during my university class on React and React Native development with Node.js.

Three of these projects are variations on a global messaging board, implemented differently to cater to web, mobile, and voice interfaces.
The other two projects include a university news mobile app and a website built for shopping and adopting cats.

Below are demonstration videos pertaining to each project:
