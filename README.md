This repository showcases the projects I had the most fun with and put the most effort into during my university class on React and React Native development with Node.js. Each repository includes a demonstration video to showcase the main functionalities of the website or mobile app.

Three of these projects are variations on a global messaging board, utilizing the same API but implemented differently to cater to web, mobile, and voice interfaces. The other two projects include a current events news app and a website built for shopping and adopting cats.
